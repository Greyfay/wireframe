            <p>So, in essence, I've been given free reign to rant. But about what, pray tell? <br>
                Excellent question. I'm hear to rant about chipmunks. What even are they. Why do they exist? Are they just upgrades of their watered down cousin, the squirrel? That may be true, but I'm hear to argue that chipmunks should exist on their own, away from the stigma of the more evil squirrel.</p>
            <p>My entire argument revolves around the fact that there is a chance for chipmunks to burst out into song. Squirrels do not have that luxury. Squirrels also have tails. We all know from elementary school that tails are the mark of the devil. Why else would calling someone a dog be deemed an insult? It is only because dogs have tails.</p>
            <p>
                I rest my case.
